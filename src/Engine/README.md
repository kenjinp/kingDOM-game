# The Game Engine, Entity Component System

Okay, I actually don't know what I'm doing here, but I like the concept.

So We have Systems, Components, and Entities.
Systems do their own things, each time we render.
Components describe the properties of entities, and are used by systems?
Entities are just data that represent game object stuff
